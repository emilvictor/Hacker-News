## Code review by:
**Moa Berg**
- `posts.php:15-16` - Input type should be ‚Äúurl‚Äù, it helps validate the input value to make sure that it's either empty or a properly-formatted URL before the form can be submitted.

- `index.php:33-43` - Delete post-button and update post-button is visible for everyone, not just for the creator of the post. Consider changing this. Now all users can delete all posts. 

- `app/posts/delete.php: 15` - The delete post form should also be validated here, for example ‚Äúdelete from posts where id = :id **and user_id = :user_id**, to prevent other users from deleting your posts. This also applies to `app/posts/postUpdate.php`.

- `app/posts/commentUpdate.php:12`- in your SQL query, validate that the user is the owner of the comment. - ‚ÄúUPDATE comments SET comment_posted = :comment_posted WHERE id = :id **AND user_id = :user_id**".

- `app/posts/store.php:11-13` - Sanitize your user-data, for example: `$title = filter_var($_POST[‚Äòtitle‚Äô], FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);`

- The project is well structured and easy to navigate, bra jobbat! ü•≥
